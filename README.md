# Shelly Green Grid Guardian

The electric power network has faced significant challenges in the past two decades, primarily due to the extensive integration of dispersed power sources, heat pumps, and electric vehicles. Operators of distribution systems throughout the EU are grappling with the issue of network overloading as a result. Efforts to address this problem are underway in various directions, primarily by encouraging users to adjust their consumption to contribute to network relief during peak load periods.

The primary objectives of the Shelly Green Grid Guardian project are focused on redistributing domestic electricity consumption to avoid unnecessary spikes in demand and reduce unnecessary energy consumption. The solution is comprised of several independent and distributed components, each contributing a small part towards achieving the ultimate goal.

Detailed descriptions of the proposed solutions can be found in the following documents:

* [Temporary Powering Down of Loads to Prevent Spikes](load-shedding.md)
* [Visual Indication of Electricity Consumption](consumption-indication.pdf)
* [Control and Monitoring of the Bathroom Heater](wallHeater.pdf)

and all the necessary source code files are included.
