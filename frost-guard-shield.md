# Frost Guard Shield

In this simulator, we exploit the method by which Shelly EM captures current measurements. For this purpose, it utilizes a split-core current transformer.

Typically, this transformer encircles a single conductor, but by creating two turns around the core of the transformer, the current is doubled.

Multiple turns cann be wound around the core of the measuring transformer, and these turns can be selectively switched on and off using switches. In this way, we simulate different currents to Shelly EM.

Below is a picture of my simulator:
